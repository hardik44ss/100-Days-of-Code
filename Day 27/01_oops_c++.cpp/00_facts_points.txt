The main intention of c++ is to add obeject oriented programming to c language
An object-oriented programming language uses objects in its programming . It  aims to emulate 
real-world concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc, in a program. 

**POP-->Procedure Oriented programing
// Main program
[func1]  .  [func2]  .  [func3] 
call function as needed
**OOP-->object oriented
works on the concept of classes and objects
A class is a template to create objects = cluster of ob jects
Treats data as a critical element
(i.e.)
Class = Animals // Basic template for creating objects
    objects=dog,cat,horse// Basic run time entities
*DAta abstraction = layers of processes,
Encapsulation=wrapping into single unit. Adding two entites
*inheritance = Similarities between others 
*polymorphism = ability  to make more than one forms //alg alg roop 
*Dynamic Binding:code which will execute in not known until program runs
*Message passing : Object.Message(information) call formate

********Benifits*******
=BEtter Code reuseability using objects and inheritance
=priniple of data hiding 
=Multiple objets coexist without any interference
=software complexity can be easily managed

/*OOps - Classes and objects
    c++ --> intialy called -> C with classes by stroustroup
    class -->exxtension of structures
    structure limitation
           -->member are public
           -->No methods
    classes = structures + more
    (can have methods and properties)
    classes can make few members as private and few as public
    structures== are typedef
    we can declare object along with class declaration      
    class student{
        //class_defination
    }hardik,sumit,mohit;// example
