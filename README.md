# 💯 100 Days of Code Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey! I started this challenge on **August 20, 2024**, and have been working hard to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. With a mix of learning from **Love Babbar's DSA series** and practicing on platforms like **LeetCode** and **Codeforces**, I'm building my coding skills every day.

## 🌟 About the Challenge

The goal is to code consistently for 100 days, focusing on:
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 🌳
- Problem-solving skills 🧠
- Competitive programming 💥

I have solved **60+ problems on LeetCode** and recently started practicing problems on **Codeforces** (since **10th September 2024**). Although I haven't participated in contests yet, I am steadily preparing for it!
